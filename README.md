Hack-A-Day is a project I'm doing in November, where I try to make 30 new projects, in 30 days.

# Day 19: Hack-A-Crop

Talk and video chat with friends.

Demo available [here](https://tilde.za3k.com/hackaday/hang).

## Bugs

- If you say no to mic and video, you won't be able to see other people in the hang. If you set it to mic-only or video-only it works fine.
- The chat scrolls off the bottom of the screen
